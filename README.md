Global Fund for animal ecology





Man and nature are one and man and animal are one family. How to strengthen animal protection and build a beautiful world in which people and animals live harmoniously have become a problem that people constantly think about. The world fund for animal ecology is committed to the relationship between animals and people that we live together, protect animal ecology, and share the earth with them.



Over the years, our human beings have made excessive use of animals and natural resources. The purpose of wwef is to make great changes to make the world a better place and to make the relationship between animals and people more harmonious and sustainable. It is necessary to respect nature and protect human life. Once upon a time, Europe launched an initiative to promote the first ban on animal use in the European Union and the first ban on animal use in the European Union, and carried out cosmetic experimental tests, which was very successful. At present, many countries have banned the use of animals for cosmetics testing. The world fund for animal ecology promotes animal protection and animal welfare all over the world. Southeast Asia, especially Thailand. Using elephants for tourism, the WFE foundation wants people to understand the back of Riding Elephants, especially the cruel training and abuse of Youxiang.



A country's attitude towards animals reflects the moral height of a country. Animal ecological protection has gradually become an international language. In terms of quantity, there are as many as 70 billion farm animals, and human beings need safe food. From the perspective of feeding, traditional industrial breeding has created a lot of pain for animals, which makes them unable to express their nature. This is a problem to be solved, in addition to large-scale factory farming. For the pressure brought by the environment, these are the problems we are concerned about, such as the unreasonable development of wildlife resources and the damage to the natural environment.



The world fund for animal ecology has general consultative status with the United Nations, and WEF hopes to engage in dialogue with global leaders and member governments to promote change. The animal sea is being polluted and destroyed. Fishing nets and fishing gear are often discarded and lost in the ocean. They will not rot, trap fish and marine mammals and damage the marine environment. The WFE foundation will work with enterprises to find solutions to this problem, to end animal abuse, to pay attention to animal welfare, and to create a harmonious world between human and animals.



The promotion of animal protection will have a positive impact on all countries; whether it is the wildlife involved in international trade, or the welfare level of environmental farm animals in industrial breeding. WFE hopes to actively promote the work, and the world fund for animal ecology will play a global leading role in improving these problems. As an international organization, the world fund for animal ecology is a long-standing organization, which will receive strong support from policy makers and enterprises to promote animal protection. Respect life and treat animals well. Nowadays, advocating the concept of green development that man and nature are the community of life has aroused great concern in the world. We can't separate animal nature from human. When natural man and animal get along harmoniously, everything will be better. When we harm wildlife or destroy their habitat, it is not only the earth or animals who are suffering, but also human beings. Our job is to help realize the beautiful vision of the future. For the welfare of animals, make the world a better place.

Technical features



Consensus algorithm is pow, belonging to the loyal party of bitcoin pow.

The mining algorithm adopts the artificial intelligence ASIC chip friendly algorithm, and introduces matrix and convolution calculation in the hashing process, so that the mining machine can be used for AI hardware acceleration service after being idle or eliminated, so as to generate additional social benefits.

Compatible with bitcoin utxo model.

The main private key account system based on HD is provided by default.

Encryption module provides SM2, SM3 standard algorithm based on national secret.

The isolated witness design is embedded.



It extends and extends the utxo model. Utxo brings good security for assets and identities.

The built-in BISC does not provide users with the ability to write their own smart contracts, which improves the security and reduces the diversity.

POW mining is compatible with the pow mining algorithm of Ethereum.

Built in digital identity, provides a digital identity based domain name system, which can be connected to digital assets.

HD type master private key account system is provided by default.

The upper limit of the block is 1MB, but the output speed is 33 seconds, about 18 times of bitcoin.

The MST token system equivalent to erc20 is provided.
